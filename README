PF: JW Embedder for Drupal 7

Requires:
* libraries - http://drupal.org/project/libraries
* remove_field- https://github.com/Pearson-Foundation/remove_field

JW Embedder Media Player

You will need to download the JW Player (http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player), 
unzip in your $DRUPAL_ROOT/sites/all/libraries so that it is $DRUPAL_ROOT/sites/all/libraries/mediaplayer

-- Skins
currently only the glow skin is supported (because it is hard coded). This will eventually 
be a settings option, but for now foolwo these instructions:

* download the glow skin (http://www.longtailvideo.com/addons/skins/196/Glow?q=%20alt=) and place 
the zip in the libraries/mediaplayer/ folder
* unzip the glow.zip so it also exists in the mediaplayer folder as a folder. This is 
necessary for HTML5.
